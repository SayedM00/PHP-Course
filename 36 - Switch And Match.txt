switch (varible) {
	case   value  :
		statement;
		break;

	case   value  :
		statement;
		break;

	
	case   value   : // you can merage two of cases.
	case   value   : 
		statement;
		break;



	default:
		statement;
}
-------------------------------
cases look like the array key and the statment looks like the the array value.

match (varible) {
	case => value,
	case => value,
	case, case => value,

}

-----------------------------

Differecses between switch and match :

match 

- match can assigned to a variable : $test = match(_)....
- match does not have to use break statment because it just return one statment  once the match is found
- match does not use default cases but if the value is not found will return an error so you have to put some default cases
- match compare the value and type of the value (1 is not "1") or match ===
- case could be any expersion like > or < ....
- match return just one statement 

switch 

- switch can not assigned to a variable
- switch have to use break statment because to return one statment  once the case is found
- if the value is not exsite in the cases will not be an error
- switch does  compare the value and type of the value (1 is "1") or switch ==
- case could not be any expersion
- switch return any statement
