By default, variables are always assigned by values.
Assigned by reference make variable alias or point to another.


Assigned By default:

$a = 1;
$b = 2;

echo $a; => 1
echo $b; => 2

Assigned By reference:

$a = 1;
$b = &$a;
$b = 10;

echo $a; => 10;
echo $b; => 10;

---
$a = 1;
$b = &$a;
$b = 10;
$a = 20;

echo $a; => 20;
echo $b; => 20;
