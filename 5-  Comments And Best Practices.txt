1. Use forward slashes // for single-line comments
Single-line comments should be used by the forward slashes method:

// CORRECT: This is a single-line comment  

/** INCORRECT: This is a single-line comment but using the asterisk method **/


2. Use forward slash + asterisk (block type) /* */ for multiline comments
Multiline comments should be used by the slash + asterisk method:

/** 
 * CORRECT: This is a 
 * multiline comments
 * in block style
**/

// INCORRECT: This is a
// wrong way of using
// multiline comments.
// Sadly, I used it a lot in my projects :-)

3. Use block type /* */ for header comments
Header comments are the starting comments of a PHP file to clarify the content to the developer.


<?php

/** 
 * This is a PHP file for viewing PHP information
**/

phpinfo();



******************** need to know what is that *********************
4. Use block type /* */ as DocBlock format to document PHP functions and classes
DocBlock is an adaptation of Javadoc for PHP programming, it allows external document generators and PHP IDEs to interpret variable types for providing code completion, type hinting, and debugging.


/**
* This is an example function
*
* @param string $text The text to do the magic
* @param int $number A number to make the magic even better
*
* @return string Return something
*/
public function magicFunction(string $text, int $number)
{
    // ...
}

5. Comments should be on their line

// CORRECT: This is a comment on its own-line
$apple = 'red';

$banana = 'yellow'; // INCORRECT: This comment should not be here
